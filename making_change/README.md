### 0\. Change comes from within

mandatory

Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount `total`.

*   Prototype: `def makeChange(coins, total)`
*   Return: fewest number of coins needed to meet `total`
    *   If `total` is `0` or less, return `0`
    *   If `total` cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return `-1`
*   `coins` is a list of the values of the coins in your possession
*   The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than `0`
*   You can assume you have an infinite number of each denomination of coin in the list
*   Your solutionâ€™s runtime will be evaluated in this task
